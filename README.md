# fractal-llms-nbs

Notebooks for the current version of the Fractal-U LLMs class

## Repo Structure  
Each lesson has a folder inside of `nbs/`

The folders are numbered according to the lesson order. 

## Folder contents  
Each folder has all of the images and assets to re-create the version of the blog-post version of the notebook. The notebooks also include all of the special formatting cells, so you can use them as a reference for your own posts.  

## How to use the notebooks  
Here are two potential workflows for using these Notebooks, choose your preferred one or a mix of them:   
- Create your own branch(es) and work off those, merging changes as needed.  
- Make a copy (or several) of each baseline notebook and make all of your changes or experiments in those.
